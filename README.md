# Tauri project

This project has been developed to show how build a native desktop application with:
- Rust / Golang as back
- VueJS as client part

Tauri is the main entry point of the application. It's a framework to build web application 
with a Rust backend.
Thanks to cgo and ffi, parts of the backend can also be written in Golang.
